**May 12, 2025**: Back in Amsterdam, Take 2! Sure didn’t sit at home for long, as it was soon after over to Thailand to attend [AISTATS](https://aistats.org/aistats2025/index.html). Awesome location, and conference was well-sized (read, not too large) to engage with various researchers. Fun to see the ABI team again, and talk to some interesting people such as [Daniel Roy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vA6ZQ_AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Aapo Hyvärinen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UnrY-40AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Bonus for the inspiring talk on [martingale posteriors](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/article/85/5/1357/7597700) by [Chris Holmes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YNoe5GAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). I didn’t know this but apparently [post-Bayes](https://postbayes.github.io/seminar/) is a thing.
