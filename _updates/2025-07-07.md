**July 7, 2025**: All good things come in 3’s this month (or rather, 2x3). All *three* co-supervised master students successfully submitted their theses, and I’m quite impressed by the final write-ups. As everyone expressed publication interest we’ll see how to materialize their work further. In addition, I’ve co-authored *three* projects that will be presented at [Uncertainty in AI](https://www.auai.org/uai2025/) in Rio de Janeiro! This is in two weeks already, so we’re off again on travels. Our works address [risk monitoring via sequential testing](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2506.16416), [using geometry for conformal prediction](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2506.16189), and some preliminary work on [equivariant model selection](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18629). Great teamwork with Rajeev and Putri, and really fun to branch out into new domains and take interesting perspectives on existing problems. Of course, always with an eye for statistical rigour ;-)
