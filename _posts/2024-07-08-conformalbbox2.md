We propose a <ins>two-step</ins> conformal approach that propagates uncertainty in predicted class labels into the uncertainty intervals of bounding boxes. This broadens the validity of conformal coverage guarantees to include incorrectly classified objects. This work substantially extends our workshop paper.
