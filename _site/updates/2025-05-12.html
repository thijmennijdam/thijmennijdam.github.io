<p><strong>May 12, 2025</strong>: Back in Amsterdam, Take 2! Sure didn’t sit at home for long, as it was soon after over to Thailand to attend <a href="https://aistats.org/aistats2025/index.html">AISTATS</a>. Awesome location, and conference was well-sized (read, not too large) to engage with various researchers. Fun to see the ABI team again, and talk to some interesting people such as <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vA6ZQ_AAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Daniel Roy</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UnrY-40AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Aapo Hyvärinen</a>. Bonus for the inspiring talk on <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/article/85/5/1357/7597700">martingale posteriors</a> by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YNoe5GAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=sra">Chris Holmes</a>. I didn’t know this but apparently <a href="https://postbayes.github.io/seminar/">post-Bayes</a> is a thing.</p>
